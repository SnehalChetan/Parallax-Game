Team challenge : `solo`

## Goal
The main goal of this assignment is to implement different layers of images to create a nice background view and give a parallax effect to these different layers. In short, multi-layered parallax effect.
- Each layer has a specific speed so overall image gives a parallax effect and looks natural.
- The first (base) layer that is ground has the fastest speed and the last (top) layer has the slowest speed.

## To-Do
- [ ] Create a basic code structure (HTML, CSS and JS).
- [ ] Research on parallax.
  - [ ] horizontal parallax.
  - [ ] multilayer parallax.
- [ ] Decide game structure.
- [ ] Download images as per game requirement.
- [ ] Try to implement parallax with game background images.
- [ ] Decide game flow and steps.
